# JBEI Python Code

This package contains Python code for general JBEI use, particularly for client interface to JBEI's
web applications at the API level. Code here is a work in progress, and should eventually be
versioned and distributed independently of (though coordinated with) specific application code
 such as EDD or ICE.

<em>If you aren't familiar with what an [API][1]
is, you probably shouldn't write your own code using these scripts, or <font color="red"><u>you
should do so with help and with great care to avoid destroying important scientific data hosted in
JBEI's web applications.</u></font>.</em>

This initial version of these scripts and API's are only supported for the purpose of automating
line creation in EDD. Feel free to write your own code against the API's defined here, but expect
some changes as we polish them in upcoming versions.

## Conventions in this document

Don't panic! :-)

These directions assume you're basically comfortable using the OSX Terminal. If not, or if you use
other Python tools such as iPython, Jupyter, Pandas, etc and aren't comfortable working with
virtual environments, it's probably best to ask for help.

File names and terminal commands below are specially-formatted to clarify that they're
associated with the `Terminal`. In a multi-line terminal block below, each line should be
executed on its own, followed by Enter.  We've made an attempt to point out how to verify that
commands work correctly on your computer, but you should generally pay attention to the command
output to notice any obvious signs that something went wrong (though unfortunately, the signs may
not always be obvious).

This stuff can be intimidating! Ask for help!

## Set up a Python 2 environment to run this code<a name=setup_python_env>
### Mac OSX<a name=setup_python_mac>

These directions are based on an older version of the EDD installation process, and haven't been 
updated for El Capitan or Sierra. Unfortunately, they won't presently work on El Capitan, and 
haven't been tested on Sierra but will hopefully be updated soon. El Capitan related issues also
affect the install process for the EDD Python development environment, and should also be
documented there.

#### Install basic development tools needed to support the scripts.
Depending on what's already installed / in use on your computer, you'll want to consider
following directions the sections below. If you're a software developer and have already configured
Docker for EDD development, you can skip this section and just run scripts from inside EDD's 
`appserver` container.  Directions below are for configuring a new Python 2 environment with only
the minimal dependencies for scripts that interact with, but aren't an integral part of, EDD.

1. Install XCode: <a name="XCode"/>
    Install XCode and associated Developer Tools via the App Store. If you type `git` at the
    command line and get a usage message rather than `command not found` or similar , you can
    probably skip this step.
    * As of OS X 10.9 "Mavericks": you can just run `xcode-select --install` at the terminal to just
    only get the command-line tools
    * Run the command below to stablish `/usr/include`:

         ``sudo ln -s `xcrun --show-sdk-path`/usr/include /usr/include``
2. Install (Homebrew)[3] <a name="HomeBrew"/>

        ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
        brew doctor
3. Install Python 2 <a name="Python"/>
    * Replace default OS X version of Python with the more up-to-date Homebrew version

        `brew install python`
    * You may need to relaunch the terminal to see the proper Python version. Test by running
    `python --version`

4. Set up your computer to allow visibilty into hidden files.

    If you're comfortable with the Terminal, and particularly with:
      * viewing hidden files
      * using command line tools to edit text files

    then there's nothing to do for this step.

    Otherwise, the simplest way forward is
    to run the command below in the Terminal. It will enable you to see hidden files in the Finder
    and in the file viewer launched by the File -> Open menu in any text editor:

    `defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES`

5. Create a [virtual environment][4] to
   isolate dependencies for these scripts from other Python code on your computer. Even if you don't
   do any other Python work at present, it's best to start off on the right foot in case you need to
   do so later on.

   * Install virtualenvwrapper

       `sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper`
   * Add the following lines to your shell startup file (e.g. `/Users/your_username/.bash_profile`), 
     or create one if it doesn't exist. Remember that because this file is hidden (starts with a '.'),
     it may not be visible by default (see previous step).
   
     Open the text editor of your choice to open/create `.bash_profile` and add the following lines:

            # configure virtualenvwrapper to isolate Python environments
            export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
            source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
   * Incorporate the changes you just made into your current Terminal:

            source ~/.bash_profile

   * Create a virtual environment for running these scripts

            mkvirtualenv jbei-scripts
            workon jbei-scripts

6. Check that your Terminal is working in the context of the the virtual environment you just
created.

    After running commands above to create a virtual environment, you'll want to get in the habit of
    checking that your terminal is using the correct virtual environment before running scripts
    included in this package, and especially before using `pip` to change the installed Python
    packages.

    To check which virtual environment your Terminal is in, run the Terminal and look at the
    Terminal's command prompt. The virtual environment name will be in parenthesis at the
    beginning of the prompt. For example:

        (jbei-python)mark.forrer@mforrer-mr:/Users/mark.forrer$
    Alternately, you can edit change your `.bash_profile` to use this virtual environment by default
    by appending the line `workon jbei-scripts` after the commands you added above.

#### Check out code to run the scripts
	
* Download scripts from [the Bitbucket repo][5]. 
  These files may eventually be hosted elsewhere, but for now the initial versions are being 
  developed/maintained concurrently with EDD.
* Do a [sparse checkout][6] 
  to get just the subsection of EDD code that you need to run these scripts. You won't want the 
  whole application codebase. For example, run the following commands:
   * Create and initialize your local repo (replacing the sample on the last line below with
   your own LDAP username):
   
	       mkdir jbei\ python\ scripts && cd jbei\ python\ scripts
	       git init
	       git remote add origin https://your-username@repo.jbei.org/scm/edd/edd-django.git
   * Enable sparse checkout so you can get just the scripts you need.

           git config core.sparsecheckout true
	   
   * Configure git's `sparse-checkout`` file to get just the script code and its dependencies in the
    EDD code

           echo jbei/* >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
	   
   * Checkout the scripts

           git pull edd-django master
	   
* Install required Python packages.

    First confirm that you're working in the correct virtualenv! See directions above.

	    workon jbei-scripts
	    pip install -r jbei/requirements.txt
	
* Add the `jbei` directory, and any desired subdirectories to the $PYTHONPATH

      cd jbei/
      PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`/jbei:`pwd`/jbei/edd/rest/scripts/

  Alternately, update the `PYTHNONPATH` in your `.bash_profile`
	   
#### Get the latest code

From the repository directory you configured, just run

    git pull

Keep in mind that new code may have been added in a different branch or in a different directory
than where your sparse checkout is looking for it! You can always browse the rest of the code in
[BitBucket][7] if that's needed.
	
#### Configure the target URL's for the script

If you're running a command line tool that targets a specific EDD and/or ICE deployment, you should 
edit configuration files to adjust which URL's are used to access those deployments.

* `jbei/edd/rest/scripts/settings.py` contains the default settings used by all the scripts in this
 directory. Its purpose is to set defaults used by the scripts to contact EDD and ICE.  If you need 
 to change the defaults in this file, create a `local_settings.py` in the same directory, and any 
 values defined in `local_settings.py` will override the defaults, but won't show up as edits when 
 you use `git` to check out the latest code. 
 
## Provided Code

Three types of code are provided in this package:

1. Python API's for accessing JBEI's web applications
2. Special-purpose scripts that use the Python API's to accomplish a task
3. General utility code, mostly in support of #1

### Python API's <a name="python_apis">

Client-side Python libraries for accessing ICE's and EDD's REST API's are currently under 
development, but are already in limited production use by EDD and by its command line tools.
These libraries aren't mature yet, but may already be helpful for other uses (e.g. in researchers' 
iPython notebooks). This code is still in active development, and is likely to change (including 
breaking API changes) over time. Feel free to use it, but use at your own risk!

See `api.py` modules for EDD and ICE under [`jbei/rest/clients/`][8], as well as other supporting modules.
Both modules are designed to follow a similar usage pattern. The example below shows how to use
EDDApi, but IceApi is very similar.

__Sample client-side use of EddApi__

    from jbei.rest.auth import EddSessionAuth
    from jbei.rest.clients import EddApi
    from jbei.utils import session_login
    
    # prompt terminal user for credentials and log in
    edd_login_details = session_login(EddSessionAuth, EDD_URL, 'EDD',
                                      username_arg=args.username, 
                                      password_arg=args.password,
                                      print_result=True,
                                      timeout=EDD_REQUEST_TIMEOUT)
    edd_session_auth = edd_login_details.session_auth

    # instantiate and configure an EddApi instance
    edd = EddApi(base_url=EDD_URL, auth=edd_session_auth)
    edd.timeout = EDD_REQUEST_TIMEOUT

    # get descriptive data for a study
    study = edd.get_study(1)

For examples of more advanced use, see usage of EddApi in the main() methods of 
[`create_lines.py`][9] or [`maintain_ice_links.py`][10]

### Command Line Tools

The following command-line tools re provided. Run each with the `--help` parameter for more detailed
information on the available options.

* `create_lines.py`: This is a stopgap script to support bulk creation of large numbers of lines for
 studies where that's necessary.  It will eventually be replaced by user interface(s) that support 
 simplified / optimized line creation.

* `maintain_ice_links.py` This work-in-progress script supports scanning linked EDD/ICE deployments 
  and maintaining the association between EDD experiments and ICE parts, which can become out-of-date
  under some circumstances (e.g. downtime or communication failure). See the 
  [draft technical documentation][2] for this script.

#### Running Command Line Tools

Running an example script from the base EDD directory: 
`python -m jbei.edd.rest.scripts.create_lines my_csv_file.csv`

Get help for a script: append `--help` to the command
